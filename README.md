# My dotfiles 

## idea
Running `setup` from this folder will create symlinks to the right places. This repo has to 100% self-contained. Maybe written in Rust?

* Have a JSON or YAML or something file that will be parsed to create the appropiate symlinks without installing anything.
* Have sub-folders, that can have their own yaml?
